# Intro
As new year 2021 is coming along, I was assigned to perform a security assessment focusing on a Kubernetes environment. I had some experience with working Kubernetes and containerlized environment before, but honestly, those technologies are like evolving crazy. I believe that Kubernetes is currently the most popular and even being most updated open-source project right now!

I thought it would be a good time to share some resources and techniques that I have learned about Kubernetes (or k8s). I would not go into nitty-gritty about Kubernetes technology itself since there are plathora resources to learn about it like Kube Academy (https://kube.academy/courses).

# Play with Kubernetes

Today, I will demonstrate how to create Kubernetes cluter using free Kubernetes playground tool: Play with Kubernetes (https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/) and deploy simple web application to expose it to the public Internet.

## Login
To login, you need to use either github or docker account. I will use docker account to login.
