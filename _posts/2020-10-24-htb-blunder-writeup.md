### Dirsearch

Used [dirsearch](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch) to further enumerate the website.

```console
# python3 dirsearch.py -u http://10.10.10.191/ -e txt,php,asp,js | grep 200

[15:41:45] 200 -  563B  - /.gitignore                               
[15:41:55] 200 -    3KB - /about                               
[15:42:00] 200 -    2KB - /admin/
[15:42:51] 200 -   30B  - /install.php
[15:42:54] 200 -    1KB - /LICENSE  
[15:43:13] 200 -    3KB - /README.md
[15:43:14] 200 -   22B  - /robots.txt  
```

When I visited to `/admin`, I was promoted to the following BLUDIT login page:

Additionally, `/.gitignore` had a list of BLUDIT script contents. By searching, I was able to identify the version of the BLUDIT CMS in `http://10.10.10.191/bl-plugins/version/metadata.json`

## Initial Foothold

### Password Bruteforcing

By Google searching, I found a potential [BLUDIT CMS 3.9.2 exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48701). But it required valid login credentials to the `/admin` page.
